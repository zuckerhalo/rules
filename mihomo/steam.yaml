  # The rule below might be needed to properly install
  # Microsoft's dependencies, so that Steam games on Linux
  # machines can be run. Akamai CDN is also used by some games.
  #
  # But, please note that Spotify and lots of other apps
  # are also dependent on it.
  # -----------------------------------------------------
  # If it so happens that it doesn't work,
  # e.g. "Running install Script(*)" takes forever.
  # You can disable that specific rule by placing
  # "akamaized.net" rule above the "games" rule-set.
